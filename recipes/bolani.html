  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bolani is a stuffed flatbread from the Afghan cuisine. It is usually filled with a mix of potatoes, 
    cilantro, and green peppers, but it can also be filled with pumpkin, red lentils, or chives. It is 
    usually served with a green chutney and enjoyed as a side dish, or as a snack with a cup of tea.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <li>1 cup (240 mL) lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1½ Tbsp (22 mL) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1½ tsp (9 g) salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp active yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups + 1 Tbsp (420 g) bread flour </li>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <li>2 large potatoes, peeled, cut into 1 cm cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup (52 g) sliced green onion</li>
        <li>1 cup (16 g) fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green chili pepper, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp (2 g) ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp (6 g) salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2½ Tbsp (37 mL) vegetable oil, for frying, divided</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To a large bowl, add the water, oil, salt, and yeast. Stir, and then add the flour. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Then knead the dough* for 3 minutes, or until soft and elastic. Add a little more flour as needed if the dough feels too sticky to work with. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature while preparing the filling.</li>
        <li>Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fully cooked through. Then drain.</li>
        <li>To a large bowl, add the drained potatoes, green onion, cilantro, chili, ground coriander, salt, turmeric, and pepper. Use a fork or potato masher to mash everything. It's okay if a few lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 8 pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece into a ball with your hands. Dust each ball with flour.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some flour on your working surface and use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a thin circle with a diameter of roughly 20 - 22 cm. We're aiming for a thickness similar to that of a tortilla. The thinner the better, but not so thin that it will rip if handled.</li>
        <li>Before adding the filling, gently lift the rolled-out dough and heavily re-flour your working surface. Spread ⅓ of a cup of the potato filling over half of the dough, leaving a ½ inch (1 cm) border along the edge. Dip your fingers in water and spread the water along this edge, only on one half of the circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough in half, over the filling, to create a half-moon shape. Press out all the air bubbles, then pinch the edges with your fingers to fully seal the bolani.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp (5 mL) of oil to a large pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the bolani to the pan. Let cook for 2 - 3 minutes or until the bottom is golden. Meanwhile, use a silicone pastry brush to brush some more oil on top of the bolani.</li>
        <li>When the bottom is golden, flip, and let cook on the other side until golden. Then transfer to a cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Cut the bolani in triangles and serve with green chutney. Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
